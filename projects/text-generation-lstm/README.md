# Text Generation with LSTM

A generative AI project that demonstrates text generation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Overview

This project implements a text generation system using LSTM networks to learn patterns in text data and generate new text in a similar style. The model is trained on sample text data and can generate new text character-by-character or word-by-word.

## Features

- Character-level and word-level text generation
- LSTM neural network implementation
- Text preprocessing pipeline
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive text generation interface
- Visualization of training progress

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the text generation demo:
   ```
   python text_generation.py
   ```

3. To train the model on custom text:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `text_generation.py`: Main implementation with pre-trained model
- `train_model.py`: Custom model training script
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `data/`: Sample text datasets
- `models/`: Saved model files
- `results/`: Generated text samples

## Results

The demo will generate sample text in the style of the training data.
